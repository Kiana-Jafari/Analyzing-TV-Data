### Analyzing TV Data

Welcome! This notebook dives into the detailed analysis of TV viewership data, aiming to uncover underlying trends, behaviors, and influential factors that drive viewer engagement. It leverages a variety of data analysis techniques, including cleaning, exploration, statistical modeling, and visualization, to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset.

In this notebook, TV viewership data is processed and explored using Python-based data analysis libraries. The dataset is first cleaned to handle inconsistencies and missing values. A combination of statistical analysis and visualization techniques is used to identify key trends, such as popular viewing times and significant spikes in audience engagement. Further, correlations between different variables are assessed to understand their impact on viewership numbers.

In this project we:
- Collected and analyzed television viewership data with the goal of identifying key trends and factors influencing audience behavior
- Applied data cleaning techniques, conducted exploratory data analysis, and visualized trends using statistical models
- Delivered a comprehensive analysis of TV viewership trends, successfully identifying factors influencing viewership peaks and troughs
- Generated impactful visual representations that communicated the core insights effectively
